#  EcoTrack – Carbon & Water Footprint Tracker

Overview
EcoTrack is a lightweight web app that helps individuals track their carbon footprint (CO₂ emissions) and water footprint (liters) based on their daily lifestyle choices.  
By raising awareness, EcoTrack empowers users to make sustainable changes in food, travel, and energy use.

This project was built as a proof of concept MVP for a hackathon.  

Problem Statement
The climate crisis is accelerating, but most individuals are unaware of their personal environmental impact.  
For example:
Eating a beef burger emits ~3 kg CO₂ and consumes ~2,500 liters of water.  
A 5 km car ride emits ~1 kg CO₂** compared to 0 kg if cycled.  

Without awareness + action, personal choices keep adding up to global problems.  

Solutions
EcoTrack provides a simple, interactive web app where users can:
1. Log daily activities (food, travel, energy use).  
2. See their carbon + water footprint instantly.  
3. Get personalized suggestions for greener alternatives.  
4. Compare footprints with friends/communities.
